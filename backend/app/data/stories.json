King Dasharatha, though mighty and just, felt a void in his heart—he had no heir to continue the glorious Ikshvaku lineage. Guided by Sage Rishyasringa, the King performed the Putrayeshti Yagna. From the sacrificial fires emerged a divine being bearing a vessel of celestial kheer. This kheer was shared among the three queens, Kausalya, Sumitra, and Kaikeyi. Soon, the palace echoed with the cries of four divine infants. Rama, the eldest, was born to Kausalya, embodying the very essence of Lord Vishnu. As the princes grew, they became masters of the Vedas and the arts of war, but it was Rama who stood out for his unparalleled virtue, calm demeanor, and unwavering devotion to Dharma. Ayodhya rejoiced as their future king bloomed into a man of destiny.",

With a single arrow, Rama ended the terror of the demoness Tataka, earning the blessings of the gods. Later, at the court of King Janaka in Mithila, Rama faced his greatest challenge yet—the lifting of heavy Shiva Dhanush, the celestial bow of Pinaka.

On one side stood the hundred Kaurava brothers, led by the ambitious Duryodhana, and on the other, the five Pandavas, led by the righteous Yudhisthira.
